## About Me

---

### Pre-2019

Welcome! I'm Jed.

I'm originally from Brentwood, TN but most recently lived in Cincinnati, OH after graduating *magna cum laude* from [Xavier University](https://www.xavier.edu/) (Go Muskies!) where I majored in Accounting and Finance and minored in Information Systems.

### Post-2019

Since graduation, I worked at [KPMG](https://home.kpmg/us/en/home.html) as in Audit working with clients in aerospace/defense and retail. After almost a year at KPMG, I transitioned to my current role in Financial Due Diligence at [PwC](https://www.pwc.com/) working with clients from consumer to tech to government. When I'm not cranking through client financial data, I'm probably taking a MOOC, binging Netflix/Prime Video/Twitch/Disney+, or deep in the rabbit hole of some random article Wikipedia.

## About the Site

---

This site is a collection of tangents that I deem worthy of posting to the internet. It'll range from random analyses to quick thoughts. Poke around, [read](https://jedraynes.com/posts/) a little, and stalk my [GitHub](https://github.com/jedraynes?tab=repositories) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jedraynes/) (no shame, I know you're going to anyway).
