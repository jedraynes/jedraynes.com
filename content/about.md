## About
---

Welcome! I'm Jed. I'm originally from Brentwood, TN and graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, *magna cum laude*, from [Xavier University](https://www.xavier.edu/) (Go Muskies!) in May 2019 majoring in Accounting and Finance and minoring in Information Systems. Since then, I've become a licensed CPA, survived nearly a year in [Audit at KPMG](https://audit.kpmg.us/), and currently work in [M&A Transaction Services - Financial Due Diligence at PwC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/deals/acquisitions/due-diligence.html) in Washington, DC. I'm currently pursing an MSc in Business Analytics at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.

Outside of work and service, I'm probably taking a MOOC, binging a Netflix show or Twitch channel, or deep in the rabbit hole of a random Wikipedia article. I'm addicted to playing Words With Friends and recently picked up PokemonGo again.

This site is a collection of tangents I deem worthy of posting on the internet. Feel free to [read my posts](https://jedraynes.com/posts/), [contact me](https://jedraynes.com/contact/), or stalk my [GitHub](https://github.com/jedraynes) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jedraynes/).

Below you can find a timeline of major events to see a brief history of my journey.
