## About
---

Welcome! I'm Jed. I'm originally from Brentwood, TN and graduated *magna cum laude* from [Xavier University](https://www.xavier.edu/) (Go Muskies!) in May 2019 majoring in Accounting and Finance and minoring in Information Systems. Since then, I've become a licensed CPA, survived nearly a year in [Audit at KPMG](https://audit.kpmg.us/), and currently work in [M&A Transaction Services - Financial Due Diligence at PwC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/deals/acquisitions/due-diligence.html) in Washington, DC. When I'm not crunching through client financial data, I volunteer with the [American Red Cross'](https://www.redcross.org/) Disaster Cycle Services and Blood Services and recently became a [Provisional EMT-B](https://www.nremt.org/rwd/public/document/emt) with the plan to volunteer further in my spare time.

Outside of work and service, I'm probably taking a MOOC, binging Netflix show or Twitch channel, or deep in the rabbit hole of a random Wikipedia article. I'm addicted to playing Words With Friends (yeah... I know it's an old game) and more recently got into sports betting. Whether the latter is a good thing or not is to be determined.

This site is a collection of tangents I deem worthy of posting on the internet. Feel free to [read my posts](https://jedraynes.com/posts/), [contact me](https://jedraynes.com/contact/), or stalk my [GitHub](https://github.com/jedraynes) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jedraynes/) (no shame, I know you're going to anyway).

Below you can find a timeline of major events to see a brief history of my journey.
