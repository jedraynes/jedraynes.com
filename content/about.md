## About
---

Welcome! I'm Jed. I'm originally from Brentwood, TN and graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, *magna cum laude*, from Xavier University in May 2019 majoring in Accounting and Finance and minoring in Information Systems. Since then, I've become a CPA, spent a year in Audit at KPMG, spent a year and a half in Deals (M&A) Financial Due Diligence at PwC, and recently started in Deals (M&A) Analytics at PwC in Washington, DC. I'm currently attending the [Georgetown University McDonough School of Business pursing a Master of Science in Business Analytics](https://msb.georgetown.edu/msba/).

Outside of work and service, I'm probably taking a MOOC, binging a Netflix show / Twitch channel, or deep in the rabbit hole of a random Wikipedia article. I'm addicted to playing Words With Friends and more recently got into sports betting (so far so good).

This site is a collection of tangents I deem worthy of posting on the internet. Feel free to [read my posts](https://jedraynes.com/posts/), [contact me](https://jedraynes.com/contact/), or stalk my [GitHub](https://github.com/jedraynes) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jedraynes/) profiles.
