## About
---

Welcome! I'm Jed. I'm originally from TN but currently live in the Washington, DC area. Here's my journey:

:office:" Work
- Jan'21 to Present: Deals/M&A Analytics Senior Associate, PwC
- Jul'21 to Dec'21: Deals/M&A FDD Senior Associate, PwC
- Jul'20 to Jun'21: Deals/M&A FDD Associate, PwC
- Aug'19 to Jun'20: Audit Associate, KPMG


:mortar_board: School
- Dec'22: Master of Science in Business Analytics, Georgetown University
- May'19: Bachelor of Science in Business Administration Majoring in Accounting and Finance and Minoring in Information Systems, Xavier University


Outside of work, I'm probably taking a MOOC, binging a Netflix show / Twitch channel, or deep in the rabbit hole of a random Wikipedia article. I'm a former Words with Friends addict and love placing horrible sports bets.

This site is a collection of tangents I deem worthy of posting on the internet. Feel free to [read my posts](https://jedraynes.com/posts/), [contact me](https://jedraynes.com/contact/), or stalk my [GitHub](https://github.com/jedraynes) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jedraynes/) profiles.
